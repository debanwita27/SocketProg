# SocketProg
A simple implementation of socket programing using React and Socket.io  

It's nothing fancy, you draw something on your screen, it shows up on the screens of other people connected to your network.  
I could call it multiplayer skribbl but really, it's just the zoom annotation feature lol.  
  
In any case, my aim was to learn socket programing. Also, p5.js is very convenient.
